## Description
This is a classic Arkanoid game developed in Java as a final project for Object-Oriented Programming course. The project demonstrates the implementation of OOP principles and design patterns.

**Key features:**
1. The game is developed using Java 17+ with JavaFX for GUI.
2. Implements core OOP principles: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.
3. Applies multiple design patterns: Singleton, Factory Method, Strategy, Observer, and State.
4. Features multithreading for smooth gameplay and responsive UI.
5. Includes sound effects, animations, and power-up systems.
6. Supports save/load game functionality and leaderboard system.

**Game mechanics:**
- Control a paddle to bounce a ball and destroy bricks
- Collect power-ups for special abilities
- Progress through multiple levels with increasing difficulty
- Score points and compete on the leaderboard

## Design Patterns Implementation

### 1. MVC
**Used in:** `All project follow MVC Pattern`

**Purpose:** The MVC pattern is to separate interface, processing, and controls to make the code easier to maintain, extend, reuse, and organize more clearly.
### 2. Singleton Pattern
**Used in:** `SoundController`

**Purpose:** Ensure only one instance exists throughout the application.

### 3. Factory method
**Used in:** `BrickFactory, GameObjectFactory
**Purpose:** Create objects easier and more structurally.
### 4. Object Pool
**Used in:** `BallTrailEffect`

**Purpose:** Optimize memory for ball trail overlays.

---

## Multithreading Implementation
The game uses multiple threads to ensure smooth performance:
1. **Game Loop Thread**: Updates game logic at 100 FPS
2. **Rendering Thread**: Handles graphics rendering (EDT for JavaFX Application Thread)
3. **Audio Thread Pool**: Plays sound effects asynchronously
4. **I/O Thread**: Handles save/load operations without blocking UI

---

## Installation

1. Clone the project from the repository.
2. Open the project in the IDE.
3. Run the project.

## Usage

### Controls
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `←` or `A` | Move paddle left |
| `→` or `D` | Move paddle right |
| `SPACE` | Launch ball / Shoot laser |
| `ESC` | Pause game |

### How to Play
1. **Start the game**: Click "PLAY" from the main menu.
2. **Control the paddle**: Use arrow keys or A/D to move left and right.
3. **Launch the ball**: Press SPACE to launch the ball from the paddle.
4. **Destroy bricks**: Bounce the ball to hit and destroy bricks.
5. **Collect power-ups**: Catch falling power-ups for special abilities.
6. **Avoid losing the ball**: Keep the ball from falling below the paddle.
7. **Complete the level**: Destroy all destructible bricks to advance.

### Power-ups
| Icon | Name | Effect |

#### PVP
- You can play with your friend, the first player uses A - D , the second player uses ← , → to move. The player who lets his ball pass through the defensive zone loses

#### Interfaces
- There are 3 different interfaces: Christmas, Halloween, and default. When switching interfaces, all sounds and images will change creating a diverse feeling.
